  This plugin allows you to send these metrics : number of tests, tests skipped, tests failed, build duration, cobertura total line coverage 
  and cobertura total branch coverage to one or more graphite servers.
  If you don't have a graphite server you can use : https://www.hostedgraphite.com to test.
  
  For cobertura metrics you need to install cobertura plugin and run cobertura:cobertura in goals section.
  
  Be sure to run jenkins in a Jdk 7, because the plugin only works with this version of jdk.
